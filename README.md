# FO20TLM

This repository contains an archive of PSK telemetry data from Fuji-OSCAR 20 and source code for a telemetry decoding program that I wrote in 1993. The code is in MS QuickBasic written for Mac PowerPC and is no longer available. I OCR scanned the pdf of the original source code and corrected many errors that were introduced during the OCR.


The telemtry archive contains data from 1990 to 1993 in a single file.
